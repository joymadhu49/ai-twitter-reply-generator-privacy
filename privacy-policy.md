Privacy Policy for AI Twitter Reply Generator (by JOY)

Last updated: 12/02/2025

AI Twitter Reply Generator (“the Extension”) is designed to help users generate AI-powered reply suggestions for tweets on Twitter (X).
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the Extension collects, how it is used, and how it is protected.

1. Information We Collect

The Extension does not collect personal information such as your name, email, password, or financial data.

However, to provide AI-generated replies, the Extension may access and process the following:

1.1 Website Content

The Extension reads tweet text and public tweet information currently displayed on the user’s active tab.

This data is used only to generate suggested replies.

1.2 User Activity

The Extension detects when the user presses the extension button or activates the reply generator.

No keystrokes, scrolling behavior, or unrelated activity is collected.

1.3 Local Storage

The Extension stores user preferences (e.g., API keys, reply style) locally on the user’s device.

This information is not sent to any external server controlled by the extension developer.

2. How We Use the Information

The information described above is used only for the following purposes:

To analyze the content of a tweet so the Extension can generate an AI-powered reply.

To save user settings for a smoother experience.

To send the tweet text to the user-selected AI provider (e.g., Gemini API or OpenRouter API) for generating a reply.

The Extension does not:

sell or transfer data to third parties

track users across websites

use information for advertising

collect personal or sensitive data

3. Data Sharing with Third-Party AI Services

When generating a reply, the Extension sends the necessary tweet text to whichever AI API the user has configured:

Google Gemini API

OpenRouter AI API

or any other AI service the user manually enters

These services process the text to generate an AI response.

The Extension does not store or retain any of this information.

Users should review the privacy policies of the API providers they choose to use.

4. Data Security

All settings and API keys are stored only on the user’s device using Chrome’s storage APIs.

The Extension does not maintain any external servers.

No user data is retained or logged by the developer.

5. Children’s Privacy

This Extension is not intended for children under 13.
We do not knowingly collect information from children.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
The updated version will be posted at the URL you provide for your extension.
